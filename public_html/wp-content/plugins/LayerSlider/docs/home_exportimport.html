<h3>Exporting sliders</h3>
<p>
	You can export your sliders for backup purposes or to move them between different WordPress installations. You can export all of your sliders in a single step, as well as selecting them individually. Your browser will download an export file containing your sliders once you hit the "Export" button. Keep this file at a secure location.
</p>
 
<h3>Importing sliders</h3>
<p>
	Choose the export file you've previously downloaded and click on the "Import" button. This will bring back your previously exported sliders. This process may take some time depending on the number of images exported along with your sliders. In some cases it's recommended to minimize the number of sliders exported within a package.<br><br>
 
	If you have an export code from an earlier version you just need to paste it into a new file and upload it in the same way. The name of the file could be anything, but you need to use the .json file extension.
