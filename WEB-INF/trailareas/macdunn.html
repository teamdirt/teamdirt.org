All units on the McDonald and Dunn Forests will be sprayed by ground application utilizing backpack sprayers.  During application, staff will be positioned at roads and official trails leading into spray areas to keep people away. The date of application, the name of the chemical used and the re-entry interval will be written on the signs posted at entry points into each herbicide application area. These signs will remain in place for two weeks.</p>

			<h4 class="subsection">Description</h4>
			<p>The McDonald Forest area has a long history in its relationship to mountain biking.  Largely due to being conveniently located adjacent to the City of Corvallis.  In reality, there are five separate land areas:  McDonald Forest (South), Peavy Arboretum (North-East), Dunn Forest (North), Chip Ross (East), and an island of land operated by Starker Forests in the center of the McDonald Forest.  The McDonald Forest, Dunn Forest, and Peavy Arboretum are managed by OSU, while Chip Ross is managed by the City of Corvallis.  Due to the number of land managers and number of visitors to the area, relationship with the mountain biking community has been an evolving process.</p>
            <p>Team Dirt has worked hard these past few years to rectify contentious areas and present a more uniform face to the mountain biking community for land managers to work with. The first ever, official mountain bike purpose built trail, <a href="/openprojects/nosecret.html">No-Secret</a>, is currently being constructed in the McDonald Forest.  There are several unauthorized trails, whose future is currently being decided.  Team Dirt has advocated for suitable unauthorized trails to become official.   If an unauthorized trail is marked with a sign, then it is best to follow that signâ€™s instructions.  The unauthorized trails are not considered during land management decisions, and thus subject to erasure.</p>
            <p>The official trails are primarily maintained by the combined effort of the mountain biking and trail running communities.  Hence, all trails are bidirectional.  Some trails are seasonally closed to mountain biking, or have a dry condition requirement (check the trail reports below for the latest conditions).</p>
            <p>There are five main parking areas, depending upon your desired starting location.  The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/x3kKw6SZcNs" target="_blank">Oak Creek Gate</a>, is the main access point for the McDonald Forest and is often where build days are scheduled to meet.  The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/44Kp4v6HSw62" target="_blank">Chip Ross Access Gate</a>, is attached to the City of Corvallis.  The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/SSHCn2nR6Fw" target="_blank">Lewisburg Saddle</a>, offers a convenient access to both McDonald Forest and Peavy Arboretum.  The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rbvyFRMaM812" target="_blank">Soap Creek Gate</a>, offers access to the northern part of the McDonald Forest.  Finally, the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/4knGzrkaFPt" target="_blank">Peavy Arboretum</a> parking lot gives access to the seasonal arboretum.</p>
