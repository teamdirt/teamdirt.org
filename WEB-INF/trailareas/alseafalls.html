			<h4 class="subsection">Description</h4>
			<p>The Alsea Falls trail system is purpose-built for mountain biking.  The land management partner is the BLM.  The project started in 2012, and has since taken off as the premier mountain bike destination in the Team Dirt purview.</p> 
            <p>The trails are unidirectional (flow going downhill). The trails are a mixture of sustainable bench-cut trail and flow trail with rollers, berms, doubles, and hips. There is a lot of smooth natural tread with some exposed root features. The most difficult trail features rocks and jumps. Difficulty is in the beginner to intermediate range. Currently the main loop is 1500ft of descent over 5 miles with a 10-mile loop back to the parking lot. With alternate routes and other lines, total trail length stands at about 7 miles.  The climb to the top of the trail system is about 3.5 miles along paved and gravel roads, taking on average between 30-60 minutes for most riders.   There is a permanent restroom in the parking lot area with picnic benches.</p>
            <p>Team Dirt hosts several build days throughout the year to maintain the current tread. In addition, an open project is ongoing to build the first difficult rated trail in the system Misery Whip.</p>
