			<h4 class="subsection">Sustainable Trails</h4>
            <p>Team Dirt only supports the creation of sustainable trails.  A sustainable trail is one which does not require constant maintenance under normal riding traffic.  The best way to achieve this is through proper drainage of water.  Building sustainable trails is part art and science.  The science part is using the correct dirt (avoiding organic material, like buried rotten logs), bench cutting into hills with the proper slope gradient, planning for turn exits, berm height and angle, placing drain exits on straight away, reinforcing high impact areas, blocking alternative routes, etc.  The art part is trying to add <i>signature</i> to an engineered trail, placement of features, flow, leaving specific roots and rocks, importing rocks, placing a trail cue, etc.</p>
            <p>A trail starts with a general topographic route, approved by the land manager and championed by the Team Dirt area manager.  However, as the trail is created different terra aspects are factored in as they are encountered.  By showing up to build days and discussing your thoughts with other builders, you have the ability to add your own requirements to the trail, hence leaving a <i>signature</i> of your own.</p>
			<p>IMBA has a good list of recommendations when building sustainable trail, available <a href="https://www.imba.com/resources/trail-building/designing-and-building-sustainable-trails" target="_blank">here</a>.  These recommendations were compiled at the 2006 IMBA World Summit.</p>

						<h5 class="subsection">Hand Tools</h5>
						<p>Team Dirt owns and provides to its volunteers hand tools for build days.  Most of the tools are repurposed from Wild Fire Suppression and include Pulaski Tools, McLeod Tools, Hoe Tools, Fire Rakes, Garden Rakes, Hand Saws, Hedge Shears, Limb Loppers, Shovels, and buckets.  </p>

						<h5 class="subsection">Power Buckets</h5>
						<p>Team Dirt has two skid steer power wheel barrows.  The power wheel barrow includes a hydraulic lift on the bucket.  This tool is essential for moving large amounts of dirt (e.g., when building berms).  A lighter duty version of this tool is planned for the McDonald Forest.</p>

						<p>The SWECO 480 Trail Dozer is a small skid steer excavating tool, perfect for trail creation.  This tool is great for roughing in the trail and is compact enough that it can fit into tight areas, meaning less revegetation work is required.   </p>
