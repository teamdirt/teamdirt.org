			<h4 class="subsection">Description</h4>
			<p>Team Dirt does not own any of the land in which the trails are built.  Trails are built with the partnership of land managers/owners.  Each land manager has their own goals and requirements for trail building, which Team Dirt works to follow.  Federal programs, such as the BLM or USFS have recreation requirements built into their charters.  Team Dirt applies for recreation grants/permits with these federal programs to allow access to building trails.  The process is similar when working with private owners, but typically these organizations are more involved in the process.  There is no mandate that these land managers give access to land, so Team Dirt works closely to follow the constraints set forth by these land managers.  If a trail is approved, then a kick off process is started internal to Team Dirt to start to raise funds (if needed), flag, and schedule build days.</p>
            <p>Team Dirt has worked hard these past few years to cultivate a working relationship with these land management partners.  By showing quality trail building practices and results the club hopes to expand on that relationship.</p>
