			<h4 class="subsection">Who we are?</h4>
			<p>Team Dirt is a mountain bike club and chapter of the IMBA. It was originally founded as a bike racing team in the Corvallis Oregon area. Since that time, it has grown into an organization advocating for all biking activity in the Benton County area. Team Dirt supports urban (Pump Track, BMX bike park, bike paths, and community events), as well as, traditional off road riding (XC, All Mountain, and DH/Gravity).</p>
            <p>Team Dirt is a 501(c)(3) non-profit community organization. The club is open to all riders, regardless of riding or building skill. Team Dirt is primarily focused on building and maintaining sustainable trails, suitable for mountain bikers, but often open for multi-purpose use. The club hosts many trail build events throughout the year, in addition too, shared build events with local IMBA chapters. Fundraising is performed via sponsorship, member donations, and a few shuttle days every year at Alsea Falls.</p>
