					Play Time Trail is the second major project undertaken in agreement with the <a href="http://www.forestry.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">OSU College of Forestry</a>, after completion of No Secret and Secret's Out in 2018.  It's expected date of completion is June 2020 so if you're reading this, you have an opportunity to come contribute to how the trail turns out.  The trail name "Play Time" was selected by a community poll.</p>

                    Like No Secret, Play Time is a 100% hand built bi-directional trail. The primary direction of travel and intended entry is at the exit of Secret's Out. The trail climbs for about 1/3rd mile before beginning a descent that is a little over a mile long, exiting at the Road 680/700 intersection. Another entrance is located near the Road 7040 spur and below this is a true multi-user trail for hikers, runners, bikers and equestrians. Above this intersection, equestrians are prohibited. The larger goal is eventually to create a continuous single track trail system connecting McCulloch Peak and the Oak Creek Trailhead.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Designed to be an intermediate level trail, there are some more difficult features with obvious beginner or intermediate ride-arounds.  The built technical features are boulder gardens and large rollers at various points.  The overall grade of the trail descent is approximately 7% and varies from short climbs short sections at 15-20%.  It will be possible for advanced riders to climb the full trail.

					Check out the Team Dirt calendar for build days. Interested folks can bring their bikes to build days and have them shuttled to or near the peak for a free ride/climb up.  Families and inexperienced builders are welcome and encouraged.
