                    The No Secret Trail is a project undertaken as an agreement with the <a href="http://cf.forestry.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">OSU College of Forestry</a> to build the first primary use designed mountain biking trail in the College Forest.  At some level the project is a test case to understand if and how future collaborations between OSU and Team Dirt can contribute to the recreational trail infrastructure of the forest.
                </p>
                <p>The No Secret trail name is a play on words, since the original un-authorized trail name was <i>Top Secret</i>.  The new trail is located roughly in the same part of the McDonald Forest.  In fact, the trail exit is the same location.</p>
                <p>
                    No Secret has been a 100% handbuilt trail, which gives it a somewhat more primitive and wilderness character and offers volunteers intimate training experiences.  The trail is meant to have a narrow tread of intermediate technical difficulty with the occasional alternative line that offers more advanced riders increased challenge.  The trail is also designed so that it is ride-climbable, friendly for trail runners and hikers and a model for sustainability, protecting riparian areas and requiring minimal upkeep year after year.  Team Dirt has had as a goal that building this trail would serve to provide the community with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A high quality intermediate level trail</li>
                    <li>Ongoing development of the cumulative community trail building expertise, as volunteers work with existing trail leaders to learn and apply technical trail building skills.  This has been borne out in the ever increasing fraction of volunteer groups that have gained build experience, they are then able to apply quickly and effectively to ongoing build day projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    No Secret is a challenging build, because it is 100% Hand-built.  We work with and follow guidelines purposed by OSU, in addition to, incorporate features for the trail-running and hiking community.  In addition, during the build we encounter a preponderance of downed woody debris that has been encountered for removal as a result of thinning operations and storm damage.
                <p>
                    The best ways to support the completion of No Secret are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get on the No Secret email list and show up for announced build days</li>
                    <li>Become a trail leader volunteer by taking OSU's Forest Volunteer Leader Certification Training (2 hours)</li>
                    <li>Donate money (we use it to support build day food, buy hand tools, promote the builds, and in the future, purchase machinery)</li>
                    <li>Share and get the word out about each build you see on the schedule and connect us with eager and willing volunteer groups, including school groups</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Power Wheelbarrow Campaign</h5>
                <p>We are currently running a captial fundraising campaign to purchase a power wheelbarrow.  This will allow us to haul more dirt and rocky objects to different parts of the trail as we begin to build more features.  This power wheelbarrow is a better fit for the McDonald Forest then traditional skid steer type barrows, since it has a single pivot tire and is a lighter duty type machine, resulting on less impact on the forest floor.</p>
