                The No Secret Trail is a project undertaken as an agreement with the <a href="http://cf.forestry.oregonstate.edu/" target="_blank">OSU College of Forestry</a> to build the first primary use designed mountain biking trail in the College Forest.  At some level the project is a test case to understand if and how future collaborations between OSU and Team Dirt can contribute to the recreational trail infrastructure of the forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                No Secret has been a 100% handbuilt trail, which gives it a somewhat more primitive and wilderness character and offers volunteers intimate training experiences.  The trail is meant to have a narrow tread of intermediate technical difficulty with the occasional alternative line that offers more advanced riders increased challenge.  The trail is also designed so that it is ride-climbable, friendly for trail runners and hikers and a model for sustainability, protecting riparian areas and requiring minimal upkeep year after year.  Team Dirt has had as a goal that building this trail would serve to provide the community with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a high quality intermediate level trail</li>
                <li>ongoing development of the cumulative community trail building expertise (as volunteers work with existing trail leaders to learn and apply technical trail building skills.  This has been borne out in the ever increasing fraction of volunteer groups that have previous build experience they are able to apply quickly and effectively to ongoing build day projects)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                No Secret has taken a long time to build for two reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>100% Hand-built to highly technical specfication (i.e., no machinary such as skid stears)</li>
                <li>Preponderance of downed woody debris that has been encountered for removal as a result of thinning operations and storm damage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The best ways to support the completion of No Secret are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get on the No Secret email list and show up for announced build days</li>
                <li>Become a trail leader volunteer by taking OSU's Forest Volunteer Leader Certification Training (2 hours)</li>
                <li>Donate money (we use it to support build day food, buy hand tools, promote the builds and, in the future, purchase machinery)</li>
                <li>Share and get the word out about each build you see on the schedule and connect us with eager and willing volunteer groups, including school groups</li>
            </ul>
